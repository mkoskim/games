This project has been made with 64-bit Linux Mint (Maya) and it is far from
easy to be compiled on other platforms at the moment. I try later simplify the
process in the future.

First things you need are:

1) dmd D compiler: This is easy to install to both Linux and Windows, and
   you can get it here:

    http://dlang.org/download.html

2) System side libraries: Linux users may find these from their distribution's
   repository, if not, you can install them from sources.

   * OpenGL 2.1+         For graphics
   * SDL 2               Input, CPU side graphics, ...
   * SDL 2 TTF           For loading & rendering fonts
   * SDL 2 Image         For loading images

   Your system should have support at least for PNG images. I'm not sure how
   std.zip is implemented, but it may require zlib.

3) D libraries:

   * gl3n: 3D maths
   * derelict: OpenGL and SDL2 bindings

   You can use 'dub' to get these. Install dub:

   * http://code.dlang.org/about

   Then, use dub to fetch libraries:

      dub fetch derelict-util
      dub fetch derelict-sdl2
      dub fetch derelict-gl3
      dub fetch gl3n

   On Linux, dub fetches sources to ~/.dub/packages/ directory. The paths
   to sources should be OK, but if they are not, you can find them from:
   
      engine/build/Makegame.mak

4) Usual Linux-side building tools:

   * GCC
   * GNU make

5) If everything is fine, you can compile and run some of the examples
   using make:

      games/testbench/pacman$ make default

Sadly to Windows users, current build system utilizes common Linux side
building tools. GCC C compiler is needed to convert BLOB.zip file to
linkable object file. I will later investigate if DMD inline assembler can
do the job.

Another sad thing for Windows users is that the project currently uses
symbolic links, but need for those is much easier to remove than find a nice
way to link ZIP package to executable on Windows (without GCC).
