This project has been made with:

    - Linux Mint 64-bit (Current: 18.1)
    - DMD compiler (Current: 2.073.2)

You may encounter compatibility problems on other platforms and compilers.
See notes at bottom.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is now setup.sh which tries to simplify installation of necessary
libraries. Try it:

    $ ./setup.sh

If everything goes right, it installs (1) system side libraries and (2) DMD
compiler. If everything does not go well, you may need to tweak your
installation manually.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To successfully compile and run projects, you will need:

1) SYSTEM LIBRARIES

   Linux users may find these from their distribution's repository, if not,
   you can install them from sources.

        * OpenGL 2.1+         For graphics
        * SDL 2               Input, CPU side graphics, ...
        * SDL 2 TTF           For loading & rendering fonts
        * SDL 2 Image         For loading images
        * Assimp 3.0+         For loading 3D models
        * Lua 5.2             For scripting
   
   Your system should have support at least for PNG images. I'm not sure how
   std.zip is implemented, but it may require zlib. Luckily, both are
   usually installed by default in Linux systems.

   You will need at least OpenGL 3.3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) BUILD TOOLS:

   Usual Linux-side building tools:

   * GNU make

   This is usually installed to Linux systems by default.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) DMD D COMPILER:

   This is easy to install to both Linux and Windows, and
   you can get it here:

        http://dlang.org/download.html

   Current version in use is 2.073.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) If everything is fine, you can compile and run some of the examples
   using make:

      testbench/pacman$ make default

   NOTE: Currently, most of the examples do not work, due to restructuring
   of game engine.

NOTES:

[1] REMEMBER to fetch submodules, too!

[2] GAME CONTROLLER: Now, with emulated controller, games can be basically played
without having a real one. But game controller is still recommended. My games
are and will be made to be played with such (XBox).

[3] Sadly to Windows users, current build system utilizes common Linux side
building tools and symbolic links. I will continue to simplify the build.
