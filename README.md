Game projects with common engine
================================

"<strike>Reinventing</strike> Reconstructing the wheel, again..." - it is a way to learn how things work.

**NOTE:** Currently, most of the examples do not compile. I am working - when
working - with new asset loading system based on assimp, integrating lua for
loading assets, and then restructure shader engine to match the changes. Meanwhile,
feel free to browse the code.
