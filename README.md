Game projects with common engine
================================

"<strike>Reinventing</strike> Reconstructing the wheel, again..." - it is a way to learn how things work.

**NOTE:** Currently I am working - when working - with new asset loading
system based on assimp, integrating lua for loading assets, and then
restructure shader engine to match the changes. At the moment, 
most of the examples do not compile. The one that I am using to develop is:

demo/objectviewer

Feel free to try it, and browse the rest of the code.
