Various tools to be written...

PLANNED:

- Level editor to support development of various technologies related to
  levels and their uses in games. There is a possibility that instead of
  desktop application, level editor is implemented/modified as Blender
  plugin (there is already one called BZTools).
  
- Object viewer -> asset explorer: It is intended that this software
  could be used to check how assets look in the game engine.

OTHER: Other possible tools are related to "offline" processing of game assets,
when needed. What I should also do, is to learn to use scripted Blender
to do the "offline" asset modifications.
