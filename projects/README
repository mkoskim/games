                        -------------
                        

Projects in this directory are bit more ambitious than the ones used as test
bench for engine creation (located in testbench/).

    Whenever I have support for loading Blender files, one project to
    test it is to try to recreate "Yo Frankie!", using the original
    Blender file(s) with recreated logic code.
    
    This is in fact demonstration project, but it would certainly teach
    me a lot about implementing games.
