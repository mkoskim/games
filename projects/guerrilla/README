The objective is to create a third person shooter game resembling a bit
"Tomb Raider 2013". Some basics:

- Protagonist is armed with few weapons, like semi-automatic handgun and
  or assault riffle
  
- Arena shooter: player advances from "arena" (closed or semi-closed area
  filled with spawning enemies) to another. Arenas are connected to each
  other, but player's abilities to go back or forward are limited.
