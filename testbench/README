                        ------------------
                        

Simple game projects in this directory serve as test bench for engine
creation, and step-by-step approach for implementing some more ambitious
game projects.

One line of development is to create 3D maze games. The planned road map
is:

    pacman/
    
        The first project is simple pacman. It demonstrates some
        fundamentals of maze based games, and games in general.

    wolfish/
    
        Wolfenstein-style first person maze shooter is a step forward from
        pacman. In addition to act as basic 3D demonstration, it is also
        planned to have at least preliminary implementation of navigation
        mesh.

    platform/
    
        At some point, I have planned to implement a simple platform game.
        This project would sketch some basics of physics.

    quakish/
    
        Combining Wolfenstein-style shooter and platform game should lead to
        regular "modern" Quake-like shooter game with three degrees of freedom.
        It is possible that this project is realized as guerrilla/ game project
        located in projects/ directory.

The technologies and solutions used in quakish/ shooter game would then be
used to prototype different kind of dungeon games.

Other lines probably follow. One is to create Asteroids-style shoot'em up.
