                             -----------


This directory tree contains some stock items possibly useful for game demos.
Most importantly, it contains the default font used by text rendering
functions, if font is not explicitly specified. Second, it contains some basic
geometric shapes for 2D/3D graphics.

Organization:

    engine/stock/           This directory

        system/             Resources needed by engine itself
        
        generic/            Generic, unsorted resources
        
        universe/           Planned place for directories containing more
                            consistent sets of assets.

In future, this directory could be organized more logically, so that games
can choose their stock item sets.
