                             -----------


This directory tree contains some stock items possibly useful for game demos.
Most importantly, it contains the default font used by text rendering
functions, if font is not explicitly specified. Second, it contains some basic
geometric shapes for 2D/3D graphics.

In future, this directory could be organized more logically, so that games
can choose their stock item sets.
