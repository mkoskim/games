Creating a nice game is not all about ideas, coding, nice images and sounds.
What mostly limits my abilities to create games is to have consistent set
of consistent pieces (characters, buildings, props, walls) to create
game levels.

This universe/ directory tree is currently empty. But my goal is to collect
some nice sets of graphics to create games to certain 'universes'. As an
example, we might have smallish 'Super Mario' universe, which would contain
Super Mario style game characters and pieces to create platforms. We might have
huge 'Skyrim' universe containing pieces, characters, animations and such to
create Skyrim-like game worlds.
