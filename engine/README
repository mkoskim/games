                                -----------

MAIN PURPOSE: Studying, learning, game prototyping & demonstrating,
experimenting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES: Current main features:

- Embedded zip archive (blob) for baking game data to executable

- TTF fonts and bitmaps

- Wavefront .obj loading (ASSIMP integration on-going)

- Texture and normal maps

- VAOs (Vertex Array Objects), VBOs, interleaved vertex data

- Bounding sphere calculation from mesh data

- Frustum culling using bounding spheres

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DIRECTORIES:

engine/asset/

	Asset loading, including BLOB management. BLOB is a zip file baked with
	the executable to contain data files the game needs.
    
engine/build/

    Build scripts and templates.

engine/doc/

    Various documents (e.g. TODO, CHANGELOG)
    
engine/ext/

    Different "extras" that are not part of the core functionality. For
    example, this directory contains CPU side bitmap manipulation, geometry
    creation, text rendering and such.

engine/game/

    Modules to implement game logic. This directory contains e.g. input event
    handling, general initialization (opening window, loading libraries), and
    Fiber class for concurrency.

engine/gpu/
	
	Lower level graphics. This includes different classes and data types to
	control GPU.
	
engine/libs/

	Static D libraries. Possible other static libraries, too.
	
engine/render/

    Modules to implement frame rendering.

engine/stock/

    Various stock items, like fonts, bitmaps, ...
