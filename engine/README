                                -----------

MAIN PURPOSE: Studying, learning, game prototyping & demonstrating,
experimenting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES: Current main features:

- Embedded zip archive (blob) for baking game data to executable

- TTF fonts and bitmaps

- Wavefront .obj loading

- Texture and normal maps

- Bounding sphere calculation from mesh data

- Frustum culling using bounding spheres

- VAOs (Vertex Array Objects), VBOs, interleaved vertex data

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DIRECTORIES:

engine/blob/

    BLOB management. BLOB is a zip file baked with the executable to contain
    data files the game needs. This directory contains different loaders to
    get data from BLOB to the game.
    
engine/build/

    Build scripts and templates.

engine/doc/

    Various documents (e.g. TODO, CHANGELOG)
    
engine/experimental/

    Possible experimental code.
    
engine/ext/

    Different "extras" that are not part of the core functionality. For
    example, this directory contains CPU side bitmap manipulation, geometry
    creation, text rendering and such.

engine/game/

    Modules to implement game logic. This directory contains e.g. input event
    handling, general initialization (opening window, loading libraries), and
    Fiber class for concurrency.

engine/render/

    Modules to implement frame rendering.

engine/stock/

    Various stock items, like fonts, bitmaps, ...
