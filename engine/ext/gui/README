                            --------
                            
For implementing a game, I will need a simple GUI/HUD for that. Here are
some initial thoughts:

* Low performance: no need to squeeze everything out of that

* Simple usage: simple and clean interface from code, no need for GUI builders,
  XML files etc.
  
* Limited capabilities: For creating fancier GUI (animations, effects, ...),
  you consider making it using 2D game objects and rendering. That is a
  different story.
