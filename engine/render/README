                            RENDERING FRAMEWORK
                            -------------------


This part of the game engine is under heavy restructuring. We can't have
one simple 'One Size Fit All' solution. Instead, we need to split rendering
framework components, to be gathered together to form an engine to suit the
need of the game.

For quick development, we would have ready-made solutions for some common
purposes, for example, generic 2D and 3D game rendering, and generic HUD
rendering.

Some thoughts...

- Game programmer knows it best. We should offer means to build up rendering
  pipeline, instead of trying to guess things. Basically this means that
  it is the programmer who classifies the game objects and chooses the
  correct mechanisms to get them to screen.

- For prototyping purposes, the framework should not be overly complex. We
  can easily sacrifice performance and special effects & features for
  flexibility.
