                            -------------------
                            
                            
(To be written) This directory contains modules for rendering the game using
OpenGL.

Some thoughts...

- Game programmer knows it best. We should offer means to build up rendering
  pipeline, instead of trying to guess things. Basically this means that
  it is the programmer who classifies the game objects and chooses the
  correct mechanisms to get them to screen.

- For prototyping purposes, the framework should not be overly complex. We
  can easily sacrifice performance and special effects & features for
  flexibility.
