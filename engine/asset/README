DATA TYPES: General data types needed for game, for example:

    - Meshes
    - Bitmaps (textures)
    - Fonts

These are used for:

    1) Loading assets (ASSIMP)
    2) Uploading GPU resources

ASSET LOADING: Asset loading pipeline overview:

    Files --> ASSIMP --> PLOP --> Shader

ASSIMP library is used to load resource files. Because ASSIMP data structures can
not be modified, we need to copy ASSIMP objects to intermediate format, and discard
ASSIMP objects.

Intermediate format is processed by PLOP (Post-LOad Processing) module. When it is
ready, it feeds the modified object to shaders. Shaders upload the resource to graphics
card, and discard the intermediate format.

INTERMEDIATE FORMAT: Intermediate format is used to create VBOs (Vertex Buffer Objects).
Because of this, intermediate format is game-specific: different games have different
needs for VBOs.
