                            ----------------

							

This directory contains D modules, which are compiled and linked to engine and
games. For other libraries, I try to use system side dynamic ones, but there
may be exceptions to this rule to allow static linking. This directory is
also for them.

Content:

    DerelictASSIMP3/        D bindings for ASSIMP library
    DerelictGL3/            D bindings for OpenGL
    DerelictLua/            D bindings for Lua library
    DerelictSDL2/           D bindings for SDL library, including:
    DerelictUtil/           Utils for Derelict binders

    gl3n/                   D library for CPU side 3D maths
