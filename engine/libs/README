                            ----------------


In general, I try to use system side libraries, but there are exceptions to
this rule:

- LUA: I really want to use scripts for various purposes, at the moment
  desperately for loading assets. LUA can be answer to this. But LUA is not
  usually installed to systems, and requiring people to install yet another
  library does not sound a good solution. So, we have LUA binary stored
  here for linking.
  
In future, I might move more libraries here. SDL could be a good canditate to
move here for static linking.
