This directory contains different kinds of demonstrations. Their main purpose
is to sketch out different kind of technologies and their use.

It is impossible to make strict separation of demos, testbenches and actual
game projects. They all serve several purposes to various levels: (1) test
benches for engine development, (2) sketching solutions, (3) demonstrate
technologies, and so on.

Still: Demos are small code snippets, and they have some kind of focus, main
purpose for their existence. Testbenches are more freeform code blocks,
more complex, and they do not necessarily have strict and simple focus.
Projects are more ambitious goals, more complete as games (or applications).
