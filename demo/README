This directory contains different kinds of demonstrations. Their main purpose
is to sketch out different kind of technologies and their use.

It is impossible to make strict separation of demos, testbenches and actual
game projects. They all serve several purposes to various levels: (1) test
benches for engine development, (2) sketching solutions, (3) demonstrate
technologies, and so on.

But still, we can find some differences:

(1) Demos are small code snippets that are assumed not to drive engine
development forward but to use existing features, and they have some kind of
focus, main purpose for their existence.

(2) Testbenches are more freeform code blocks, more complex, driving engine
development, and they do not necessarily have strict and simple focus, but they
serve as intermediate steps towards actual game projects.

(3) Projects are more ambitious goals, more complete as games (or
applications), and they are main drivers for engine development.
