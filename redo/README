						Game clones / ports
						-------------------

Some smaller games that are (incomplete) clones of some existing one.
Here are few that I have been thinking:

shmup/

	Porting my Java applet shoot'em up.
	
diamonds/

	Porting my Java applet diamonds game. This non-realtime game is more
	about GUI.

yofrankie/

    Whenever I have support for loading Blender files, one project to
    test it is to try to recreate "Yo Frankie!", using the original
    Blender file(s) with recreated logic code.
    
    This is in fact demonstration project, but it would certainly teach
    me a lot about implementing games.

Other possibly interesting could be:

- Space Invaders
- Asteroids (either classic or 3D)
